            <p>
                I'm currently a senior at <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/">Tufts University School of Engineering</a> studying
                Computer Science. I am a programmer, teacher, designer, tech geek, and virtual reality enthusiast. </br></br>

                Last summer, I worked at <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/">Bloomberg</a> as a software engineering intern. Before that, I interned as a software engineer at <a href="http://www.redlinetrading.com/">Redline Trading Solutions</a>. I've also taught in the past for <a href="https://registration.xenegrade.com/abschools/courseDisplay.cfm?schID=8698">Acton Community Education</a> and <a href="http://www.veritasprep.com/">Veritas Prep</a>. I'll be TA'ing <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/105/">COMP105 (Programming Languages)</a> in fall 2016. </br> </br>

                I was born on April 14th, 1995 in <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Yifeng,+Yichun,+Jiangxi,+China/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x342450e204651411:0xd72eb77399c2dc98?sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiz7af28bHNAhUBKB4KHffIBgcQ8gEIdDAP">YiFeng, Jiangxi, China </a>. My parents moved around a lot when I was younger, so I have lived in
                many places such as Shanghai, Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Ontario, and Osaka. I first moved to the United States when I was 4 years
                old to Arlington, MA, where I attended elementary school. My family then moved to Acton, MA after I finished elementary school,
                where I completed junior high and <a href="http://abrhs.abschools.org/">high school</a>.</br> </br>

                Starting from the 7th grade, I was an avid track runner. I ended up picking up the hurdles in high school, and ran
                college track for two years at Tufts. My <a href="http://www.athletic.net/TrackAndField/Athlete.aspx?AID=1683159#/L0">highschool</a> and <a href="https://www.tfrrs.org/athletes/4680889/Tufts/Henry_Zhou.html">college</a> times if you're curious. </br> </br>

                I first started learning how to program my freshman year of college. The first programming language introduced to me was
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_(Unix_shell)">bash</a> (I've
                picked up a lot more languages since then)! Throughout my years at college, I've explored a lot of neat CS things
                like web programming, computer graphics, machine learning/NLP, computer architecture, and many more. </br> </br>

                <!--I've also made some neat <a href="projects.html">stuff</a>.</br></br>-->

                Besides programming, I really enjoy teaching. I think <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">technology</a> has huge potential to impact education
                for the better. </br> </br>

                In my spare time, I like to read, play sports, <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, go to interesting <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Boston-Virtual-Reality/">meetup groups</a>, and cook (but mostly eat).
                </br></br>

                I have been a resident Masshole for the past 17 years. Currently living in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somerville,_Massachusetts">02144</a>.

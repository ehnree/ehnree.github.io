			My name is Henry Zhou. I was born in YiFeng, China. Growing up, my family moved around a lot. <br>
			Some of the places I have lived in include China, Canada, and Japan. I moved to the United <br>
			States when I was 4 years old, and I have resided in Massachusetts ever since. I attended <br>
			Thompson Elementary School in Arlington, went to RJ Grey Jr High School in Acton, and <br>
			I attended Acton Boxborough Regional High School. <br> <br>
			Currently, I am a sophomore at Tufts University where I am pursuing a degree <br>
			in computer science. When I am not coding, I spend my time hurdling for <br>
			the Tufts Track and Field team. I also enjoy listening to music, cooking, and <br>
			playing video games. <br> <br>

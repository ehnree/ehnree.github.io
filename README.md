Time Spent on Assignment: 3 hours

Description//////

Website consists of files:
	index.html - homepage
	bio.html - Brief biography
	resume.html - Resume
	style.css - Stylesheet for prev 3 pages

	All files pass their respective W3C HTML5 and CSS standards.
	All styling was successfully implemented via style.css. 
	Website utilizes concept of wrapper <div> blocks 
	in order to place two <div> blocks side-by-side on the
	same line. 

	style.css utilizes a myriad of different styling 
	effects to achieve the resulting website. Website
	also implements a custom .otf font with a 
	font-face block. <div> block placement is 
	achieved with careful usage of margin, float,
	and alignment characteristics. 

	Instace of div.head class
	is used across every page to distinguish which
	page is loaded (resume, bio, index).
